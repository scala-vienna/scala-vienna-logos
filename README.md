## Vienna Workshop
![Vienna Scala User Group](https://raw.github.com/scala-vienna/scala-vienna-logos/master/vienna-workshop/vienna-scala-user-group-logo_150px.png)

This logo is a homage to both the [Wiener Werkst√§tte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Werkst%C3%A4tte) and [The Third Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Man) film. Harry Lime will no longer be able to say that [500 years of democracy and peace in Switzerland only produced the cuckoo clock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cydkTy6GmFA) since we have now Scala from [EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/) now too! ;-)
The logo uses the [Vienna Workshop font](http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/hanoded/vienna-workshop), is available in several sizes in PNG form and in scalable vector form as SVG and PDF files, as well as in editable Adobe Illustrator format (AI file).
